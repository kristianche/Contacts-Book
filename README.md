# Contacts-Book
This is a simple Node JS app. I have modifed this the controllers of this app to send metrics which then i can send to Prometheus and visualize them using Grafana. I have also set up an AlertManager to send me email and a web hook(webhook site) if a specific event occurs.

# Start the Application

1. npm install
2. npm start

You can see the metrics at localhost:8080/metrics.
